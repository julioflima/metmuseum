## Node.JS Challenge

## Timeframe: 3 Hours

## Subject: Artwork

## Objective 
Your challenge is to use the Metropolitan Museum's API (https://metmuseum.github.io/) to  create a website. 

## Brief 
You bought a smart frame that can connect to the internet, and you want to use it to show  artwork in your house. 
Using Node and any framework your task is to create an interactive website that displays  artwork that you pull from the Metropolitan Museum's API. 
Specifications 
• The website should change artworks every 10 seconds 
• When tapping on an artwork, display additional information about the artwork • When displaying the art information, the timer should stop 
• Build the frontend with the templating language that is included with the  framework. If you're not using a framework, or the framework does not include a  templating language, you are free to use any library of your choice 
• The screen size is 24 inches (0.61 m), and the recommended resolution is 1920  × 1200

## Met Museum API 
For this challenge, you should use the Object and Objects endpoints. They are both listed  at https://metmuseum.github.io/. The Objects can be used to get valid Objects IDs to use in  the Object endpoint. 
You can also go beyond and use the Departments and Search endpoints to make the  artworks selected more thematic, but this is optional.

## Evaluation Criteria 
• Node best practices 
• Show us your work through your commit history 
• We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to  demonstrate how to structure components in a small program 
• Completeness: did you complete the features? 
• Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways? • Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way? 
• Testing: is the system adequately tested?
• Beware of failed requests to the API. What should the page show if the request  fails? 
• When to download the next image? Should I download after the timer or during  the timer? 
• Be careful with the image display and its resolution
